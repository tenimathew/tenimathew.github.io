## Privileges

A privilege is a right to execute a particular type of SQL statement or to access another user's object. There are two categories of privileges:
System Privileges

- A system privilege is the right to perform a particular action
- Only users who have been granted a specific system privilege with the ADMIN OPTION or users with the system privileges such as GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE or GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE can grant or revoke system privileges to other users
- Cannot grant system privileges and object privileges in single statement
- ADMIN OPTION is available while creating SYSTEM privileges only.
