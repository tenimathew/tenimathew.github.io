## Oracle Versions Milestones

### Version 6

PL/SQL language introduced

### Version 7

PL/SQL stored program units introduced

### Version 8

Support for table partitioning

### Version 8i

'i' stands for internet computing. Provided native support for internet protocols and server-side support for Java enabling the database to be deployed in a multitier environment.

### Version 9i

Introduced Oracle RAC enabling multiple instances to access a single database simultaneously.
The benefits of Real Application Clusters are:

- Ability to spread CPU load across multiple servers
- Continuous Availability / High Availability (HA)
  - Protection from single instance failures
  - Protection from single server failures
- Scalability

### Version10g

- 'g' stands for grid computing (A computing architecture that coordinates large numbers of servers and storage to act as a single large computer).
- This release enabled organizations to virtualize computing resources by building a grid infrastructure based on low-cost commodity servers. A key goal was to make the database self- managing and self-tuning.
- Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM) helped achieve this goal by virtualizing and simplifying database storage management.

### Version 12c

- 'c' stands for cloud computing.
- Introduced Multitenant architecture. The multitenant architecture enables an Oracle database to
  function as a multitenant container database (CDB). A CDB includes zero, one, or many pluggable
  databases (PDBs).
- A PDB is a portable collection of schemas, schema objects, and non-schema objects. You can
  unplug a PDB from a CDB and plug it into a different CDB.
- All Oracle databases before Oracle Database 12c were non-CDBs. Connect using CMD

## Connect using CMD

```sql
CMD> SET ORACLE_SID=orcl
CMD> sqlplus hr/hr
SQL> SHOW user;
----
CMD> sqlplus /nolog --not connected to any user
----
CMD> sqlplus sys/oracle as sysdba@192.168.11.1:1521/orcl --login as DBA to different machine
----
CMD> sqlplus / as sysdba --login as DBA using system credentials
----
SQL> SELECT name from v$database; --Shows the database which is currently connected
```

## Save to file

```sql
SPOOL filename
SET TIME ON TIMING ON -- to show the time SPOOL OFF
```

## DROP a user

```sql
DROP USER username;
----
DROP USER username CASCADE; -- delete all the objects created by user
```

## DROP User if the user is connected to database

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM ENABLE RESTRICTED SESSION; --By default, database is in OPEN STARTUP mode
--Now we changed from OPEN to RESTRICTED
-- In RESTRICTED mode, the users who are already connected can continue their work without any interruptions unless they are somehow disconnected
--If they are disconnected, they need RESTRICTED privilage to connect to database again in RESTRICTED mode
-- No new user can connect to the database
SELECT sid, serial# FROM v$session WHERE username ='username';--Get the serial number of user which we want to drop.
-- We got SID = 67 and SERIAL # = 638
ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION '67,638';-- disconnect the user from database DROP USER username CASCADE;-- drop the user\
ALTER SYSTEM DISABLE RESTRICTED SESSION; -- back to OPEN mode
```

## UNLOCK a User

```sql
ALTER USER username IDENTIFIED BY password ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
```

## Create an EXTERNAL User(Operating system user)

```sql
CMD> hostname -- to get hostname of the system
CMD> echo %username% -- get username
SQL> SHOW PARAMETER OS; -- take the value of 'os_authent_prefix'
--Name of external user should be prefixed with value of os_authent_prefix + hostname + \ + username
SQL> CREATE USER "OPS$HOSTNAME\USERNAME" IDENTIFIED EXTERNALLY;
SQL> GRANT CREATE SESSION TO "OPS$HOSTNAME\USERNAME";
CMD> sqlplus / -- to login to sqlplus as external user
```

## Synonyms and Alias

Synonyms are a type of database objects. They refer to other objects in the database. A public synonym and a private synonym can exist with the same name for the same table.

```sql
CREATE [PUBLIC] SYNONYM synonym_name FOR object_name;
```

Alias is just another name for view, table or column inside a query. It does not create an object.

```sql
SELECT ename AS name FROM emp;
```

## SQL Commands

### DDL (Data Definition Language)

Used to define the structure of the database.

```sql
CREATE DROP ALTER TRUNCATE COMMENT PURGE RENAME
```

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Used to manage the data in the database

```sql
INSERT UPDATE DELETE
```

### DCL (Data Control Language)

Used to control the access to database and various permissions.
It is also considered as a DDL command.

```sql
GRANT REVOKE
```

### TCL (Transaction Control Language)

Used to manage the transactions made by the DML commands

```sql
COMMIT ROLLBACK SAVEPOINT
```

```sql
SAVEPOINT sp1;
ROLLBACK TO sp1;
```

### DQL (Data Query Language)

Used to retrieve data from the database

```sql
SELECT
```

## SQL Constraints

```sql
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY
CHECK
```

### Data Dictionary (Constraints)

```sql
USER_CONSTRAINTS -- brief
USER_CONS_COLUMNS -- detailed
```

## Tip

```sql
--Copy structure and data from a table:
CREATE TABLE t2_name AS SELECT * FROM t1_name; --only the NOT NULL constraint defined on the specified columns would be passed to the new table.
--Copy only structure of a table:
CREATE TABLE t2_name AS SELECT * FROM t1_name WHERE 1=2; --Create a table with selected column from another table
CREATE TABLE t2_name AS SELECT empno,ename,sal FROM emp WHERE 2 = 1 ;
--Insert into table from another table
INSERT INTO temp_emp SELECT * FROM employees;
----
INSERT INTO temp_emp (employee_id,first_name) (SELECT employee_id,first_name FROM employees);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl_student(
    s_id NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT pk_sid PRIMARY KEY,
    s_fname VARCHAR2(20) CONSTRAINT uk_sfname UNIQUE,
    s_lname VARCHAR2(20) CONSTRAINT nn_slname NOT NULL,
    s_join VARCHAR2(20) DEFAULT ('New Joinee'),
    s_gender CHAR(1) CONSTRAINT chk_sgender CHECK(s_gender IN('m','f')), s_marks NUMBER(3),
CONSTRAINT fk_smarks FOREIGN KEY(s_marks) REFERENCES tbl_player(pid) --should be a primary key );
----
ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT pk_prdmstr; --drop constraint
----
ALTER TABLE product_master ADD CONSTRAINT pk_prdmstr PRIMARY KEY (product_id,product_name); -- Composite PK
----
ALTER TABLE books ADD CONSTRAINT fk_bk FOREIGN KEY (book_author_id) REFERENCES authors (author_id)
[ON DELETE NO ACTION] --Default; Won't allow to delete parent row
[ON DELETE SET NULL] --Sets the foreign key row as NULL if parent row is deleted;
[ON DELETE CASCADE] --Deletes the foreign key row also if parent row is deleted
----
ALTER TABLE product_master DISABLE CONSTRAINT pk_prdmstr; -- disable constraint
----
ALTER TABLE product_master ENABLE CONSTRAINT pk_prdmstr;
----
ALTER TABLE tbl_player ADD (full_name VARCHAR2(20)); -- add column
----
ALTER TABLE tbl_player MODIFY (full_name VARCHAR2(40)); -- modify column
----
ALTER TABLE emp RENAME COLUMN gender to sex; --rename column
----
ALTER TABLE tbl_player DROP COLUMN full_name; --drop column
----
ALTER TABLE test RENAME TO example; --rename table
RENAME TEMP_TEST TO TEMMP_TEST; --rename table
----
ALTER TABLE table_name READ ONLY; -- Read only for other users as well as owner. If you want to restrict other users only, then grant SELECT privilege only
ALTER TABLE table_name READ WRITE;
```

## WITH Clause

- The SQL WITH clause allows you to give a sub-query block a name (also called sub-query refactoring) (cannot use table name), which can be referenced in several places within the main SQL query.
- For debugging/development purposes it's sometimes useful to store results in Global Temporary Tables; however, that's not a best practice for production code.

```sql
WITH emp AS(
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10)
SELECT * FROM emp;
----
WITH employee (id, firstname, lastname, hobbies) AS
    (SELECT 1, 'a', 'b', '1' FROM DUAL UNION SELECT 2, 'a', 'b', '2' FROM DUAL UNION SELECT 3, 'a', 'b', '3' FROM DUAL UNION SELECT 5, 'e', 'f', '2' FROM DUAL)
SELECT *
FROM employee;
```

### Global Temporary Table

- Used to store session specific data. After session gets disconnected, these tables will be flushed.
- It is faster than normal table as it is temporary.

```sql
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE table_name (column_definition [,column_definition]) [ON COMMIT {DELETE | PRESERVE} ROWS]
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE students (stud_id NUMERIC(10) NOT NULL ,
name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL)
ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;
--PRESERVE ROWS - table is bound to a session. After session disconnects, it will be deleted --DELETE ROWS - table is bound to a transaction. After a transaction ends, it will be deleted. Default.
```

## Group by and Having

**GROUP BY** is used to group rows that have same values. Optionally it is used in conjunction with aggregate functions to generate report.

**HAVING** condition is used to restrict the rows affected by the GROUP BY clause. It is similar to WHERE clause.
