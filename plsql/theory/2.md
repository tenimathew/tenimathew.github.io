## Control Statements

### Simple CASE

```sql
SELECT product_id, company_name, 
    (CASE product_id
        WHEN 'p1' THEN 'Cameras' 
        WHEN 'p2' THEN 'Mobiles' 
            ELSE 'Not available'
    END) AS product 
FROM product;
```

### Searched CASE

```sql
SELECT product_id, company_name, 
    (CASE
        WHEN product_id = 'p1' THEN 'Cameras' 
        WHEN product_id = 'p2' THEN 'Mobiles' 
        WHEN product_id = 'p3' AND company_name = 'Samsung' THEN 'TV' 
        ELSE 'Not available'
    END) AS product 
FROM product;
```

### IF statement

```sql
IF condition THEN 
    --Statement1;
ELSIF condition THEN 
    --Statement2;
ELSE 
    --Statement3;
END IF;
```

### Simple Loop

```sql
LOOP
    --statement1;
    EXIT WHEN condition; 
END LOOP;
----
LOOP
    --statement1;
    IF condition THEN 
        EXIT;
    END IF; 
END LOOP;
```

### Cursor For Loop

```sql
FOR loop_counter IN cursor_name LOOP 
    --statement1;
END LOOP;
```

### Numeric For Loop

```sql
FOR loop_counter IN [REVERSE] lower_limit .. Upper_limit LOOP
    --statement1;
END LOOP;
```

### GOTO

A GOTO statement in PL/SQL programming language provides an unconditional jump from the GOTO to a labeled statement in the same subprogram. 

```sql
DECLARE
    a NUMBER(2) := 10; 
BEGIN
    <<LOOPSTART>>
    WHILE a < 20 LOOP 
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (a);
        a := a + 1;
        IF a = 15 THEN 
            a := a + 1;
            GOTO LOOPSTART; 
        END IF;
    END LOOP; 
END;
```

### RETURN

The RETURN statement immediately completes the execution of a subprogram and returns control to the caller. In procedures, a RETURN statement cannot contain an expression. The statement just returns control to the caller before the normal end of the procedure is reached. Do not confuse the RETURN statement with the RETURN clause in a function spec, which specifies the datatype of the return value.

### While Loop

- Best usable when number of iterations to be performed are unknown
- Executes till the condition become FALSE
```sql
WHILE condition LOOP
   --statement1;
END LOOP;
```

### EXIT
When the EXIT statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.
If you are using nested loops (i.e., one loop inside another loop), the EXIT statement will stop the execution of the innermost loop and start executing the next line of code after the block.

### EXIT WHEN
```sql
EXIT WHEN condition;
```
The EXIT WHEN statement allows the condition in the WHEN clause to be evaluated. If the condition is true, the loop completes and control passes to the statement immediately after the END LOOP.

### CONTINUE
The CONTINUE statement causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and it forces the next iteration of the loop to take place.

## Software Architecture

### One-Tier Architecture
Contains all the layers in a single software package. Ex: Local software

### Two-Tier Architecture
Also known as client-server application. Client system handles both presentation layer and application layer, database server handles data layer. Ex: Email client software

### Three-Tier Architecture
Also known as web based application. Client system handles
presentation layer, application server handles application layer and database server handles data layer. Ex: Gmail

## Data dictionary
A read-only collection of metadata (data about data) about database tables and views containing reference information about the database, its structures, and its users.

## Instance vs. Database
Instance is the combination of the system global area (SGA) and background processes (PMON,SMON etc.). An instance is associated with one and only one database. In an Oracle Real Application Clusters configuration, multiple instances can access a single database simultaneously. A *database* is a set of physical files on disk, that store data. An instance can exist without a database and a database can exist without an instance. To switch instance in a database system, one needs to change the value of *ORACLE_SID*. 
```sql
SET ORACLE_SID=orcl 
```
Database Configuration Assistant(DBCA) can be used to create single instance databases, or it can be used to create or add instances in an Oracle Real Application Clusters environment.
