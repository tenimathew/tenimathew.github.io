## Environment Variables
On the Windows platform, Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) automatically assigns values to ORACLE_BASE, ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_SID in the Windows registry.

*ORACLE_HOME* - C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server
*ORACLE_BASE* - C:\oraclexe\app\oracle

## Schema
A schema is the set of database objects (tables, indexes, views, etc) that belong to a user. A database user owns a database schema, which has the same name as the user name.

## Logical Storage Structures

### Data blocks
Data blocks are the smallest units of storage that oracle can
use or allocate. One logical data block corresponds to a
specific number of bytes of physical disk space. Each
operating system has what is called a block size. Oracle
requests data in multiples of Oracle blocks, not operating
system blocks. Therefore, you should set the Oracle block size to a multiple of the operating system block size to avoid unnecessary I/O. Usually 8 kb
