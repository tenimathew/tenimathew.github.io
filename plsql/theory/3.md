## Environment Variables
On the Windows platform, Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) automatically assigns values to ORACLE_BASE, ORACLE_HOME and ORACLE_SID in the Windows registry.

*ORACLE_HOME* - C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server
*ORACLE_BASE* - C:\oraclexe\app\oracle

## Schema
A schema is the set of database objects (tables, indexes, views, etc) that belong to a user. A database user owns a database schema, which has the same name as the user name.

## Logical Storage Structures

### Data blocks
Data blocks are the smallest units of storage that oracle can
use or allocate. One logical data block corresponds to a
specific number of bytes of physical disk space. Each
operating system has what is called a block size. Oracle
requests data in multiples of Oracle blocks, not operating
system blocks. Therefore, you should set the Oracle block size to a multiple of the operating system block size to avoid unnecessary I/O. Usually 8 kb

### Extents
Extents are the logical unit of database which is made of contiguous multiple numbers of the oracle data blocks. Default is 1 MB

### Segments
A segment is a set of extents which has been allocated for a specific data structure and all of which are stored in the same tablespace. For example, each table's data is stored in its own data segment, while each index's data is stored in its own index segment. If the table or index is partitioned, each partition is stored in its own segment. Whenever the existing space in a segment is completely used or full, oracle allocates a new extent for the segment. So the extents of a segment may or may not be contiguous on disk. The segments also can span datafiles, but the individual extents cannot.

### Tablespaces
Tablespaces are the bridge between physical and logical components of the Oracle database. A tablespace is made up of one or more database datafiles. The datafiles are created automatically when the tablespace is defined. When you create a tablespace, you define the initial size of the associated datafile.

## Types of Tablespaces
SYSTEM and SYSAUX tablespaces are always created when the database is created. The SYSTEM tablespace always contains the data dictionary tables for the entire database. The SYSAUX tablespace is an auxiliary tablespace to the SYSTEM tablespace.

### Permanent Tablespace
Contains persistent schema object. Data persist beyond the duration of a session or transaction. Objects in permanent tablespaces are stored in data files.

### Temporary Tablespace
Temporary tablespaces are used for special operations, particularly for sorting data results on disk and for hash joins in SQL. For SQL with millions of rows returned, the sort operation is too large for the RAM area and must occur on disk. The temporary tablespace is where this takes place.

### Undo Tablespace
- Oracle Database keeps records of actions of transactions, before they are committed. These information are used to rollback or undo the changes to the database. These records are called rollback or undo records.
- When the instance starts up, the database automatically selects for use the first available undo tablespace. If there is no undo tablespace available, the instance starts, but uses the SYSTEM rollback segment for undo. This is not recommended, and an alert message is written to the alert log file to warn that the system is running without an undo tablespace.
- Committed undo information normally is lost when its undo space is overwritten by a newer transaction.
- The default value for the UNDO_RETENTION parameter is 900 seconds. The system retains undo for at least the time specified in this parameter.
- You can set the UNDO_RETENTION in the parameter file: UNDO_RETENTION = 1800
```sql
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET UNDO_RETENTION = 2400;
```
- You can set *RETENTION* clause to either *GUARANTEE* or *NOGUARANTEE*. It specifies the database should preserve the unexpired undo data. This setting is useful if you need to issue an Oracle Flashback Query to correct a problem with the data. *RETENTION NOGUARANTEE* returns the undo behavior to normal. Space occupied by unexpired undo data in undo segments can be consumed if necessary by ongoing transactions. This is the default.
- You can create more than one undo tablespace but only one of them can be active at any given time.

### Small-file Tablespace
Default type of tablespace in Oracle database. Can have multiple data files. Maximum of 1022 data files are allowed.
