## Interview Questions 3

- Get number of objects per owner

```sql
SELECT owner, COUNT (owner) number_of_objects
FROM dba_objects
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY number_of_objects DESC;
```

- Convert number to words

```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR (TO_DATE (1526, 'j'), 'JSP') FROM DUAL;
--j= julian calendar format
--jsp = convert into words lower character
--JSP = upper
Output:
one thousand five hundred twenty-six
```

- Find string in package source code

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dba_source
WHERE UPPER (text) LIKE '%FOO_SOMETHING%' AND owner = 'OWNER_NAME';
```

- Convert Comma Separated Values into Table

```sql
WITH csvs AS
    (SELECT 'AA,BB,CC,DD,EE,FF' AS csvdata FROM DUAL)
SELECT REGEXP_SUBSTR (csvs.csvdata, '[^,]+', 1, LEVEL) pivot_char
FROM DUAL, csvs
CONNECT BY REGEXP_SUBSTR (csvs.csvdata,'[^,]+', 1, LEVEL) IS NOT NULL;
--The query can come quite handy when you have comma separated data string that you need to convert into table so that you can use other SQL queries like IN or NOT IN
```

- Find the last record from a table

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE ROWID IN (SELECT MAX (ROWID) FROM employees);
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
MINUS
SELECT * FROM employees
    WHERE ROWNUM < (SELECT COUNT (*) FROM employees);
--Use this when your table does not have primary key or you cannot be sure if record having max primary key is the latest one.
```

- Check if table contains any data

```sql
SELECT 1 FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE ROWNUM = 1;
```

- Row Data Multiplication in Oracle

```sql
WITH tbl AS
        (SELECT -2 num FROM DUAL
        UNION
        SELECT -3 num FROM DUAL
        UNION
        SELECT -4 num FROM DUAL),
    sign_val AS
        (SELECT CASE MOD (COUNT (*), 2)
                WHEN 0 THEN 1
                ELSE -1 END val
        FROM tbl WHERE num < 0)
SELECT EXP (SUM (LN (ABS (num)))) * val FROM tbl, sign_val
GROUP BY val;
```

- Generating Random Data In Oracle

```sql
SELECT LEVEL empl_id,
    MOD (ROWNUM, 50000) dept_id,
    TRUNC (DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE (1000, 500000), 2) salary,
    DECODE (ROUND (DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE (1, 2)), 1, 'M', 2, 'F') gender, TO_DATE (
    ROUND (DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE (1, 28)) || '-'
    || ROUND (DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE (1, 12))
    || '-'
    || ROUND (DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE (1900, 2010)), 'DD-MM-YYYY')
    dob,
    DBMS_RANDOM.STRING ('x', DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE (20, 50)) address
FROM DUAL
CONNECT BY LEVEL < 10000;
```

- Random number generator in Oracle

```sql
SELECT ROUND (DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE () * 100) + 1 AS random_num FROM DUAL; --Change the multiplier to number that you want to set limit for.
```

- To fetch ALTERNATE records from a table. (EVEN NUMBERED)

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE ROWID IN
    (SELECT DECODE(MOD(ROWNUM,2),0,ROWID, NULL) FROM emp);
```

- To select ALTERNATE records from a table. (ODD NUMBERED)

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE ROWID IN
    (SELECT DECODE(MOD(ROWNUM,2),0,NULL ,ROWID) FROM emp);
```

- Find the 3rd MAX salary in the emp table.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT sal FROM emp e1 WHERE 3 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sal) FROM emp e2 WHERE e1.sal <= e2.sal);
```

- Find the 3rd MIN salary in the emp table.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT sal FROM emp e1 WHERE 3 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sal) FROM emp e2 WHERE e1.sal >= e2.sal);
```

- Select LAST n records from a table

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp MINUS SELECT * FROM emp WHERE ROWNUM <= (SELECT COUNT(*) - &n FROM emp);
```

- List dept no., Dept name for all the departments in which there are no employees in the department.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dept WHERE deptno NOT IN (SELECT deptno FROM EMP);
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM dept a WHERE NOT EXISTS
    (SELECT * FROM emp b WHERE a.deptno = b.deptno);
```

```sql
SELECT empno,ename,b.deptno,dname FROM emp a, dept b
WHERE a.deptno(+) = b.deptno AND empno IS NULL;
```
