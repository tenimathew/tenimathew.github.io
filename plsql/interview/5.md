- What is a difference between ON DELETE CASCADE and ON DELETE SET NULL?

  - ON DELETE CASCADE Indicates that when the row in the parent table is deleted, the dependent rows in the child table will also be deleted.
  - ON DELETE SET NULL Coverts foreign key values to null when the parent value is removed. Without the ON DELETE CASCADE or the ON DELETE SET NULL options, the row in the parent table cannot be deleted if it is referenced in the child table.

- What is a Candidate Key?

  - The columns in a table that can act as a Primary Key are called Candidate Key.

- Write a PL/SQL Program which raise a user defined exception on thursday?

```sql
DECLARE
    a EXCEPTION
BEGIN
    IF TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'DY')='THU' THEN
        RAISE a;
    END IF;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN a THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('my exception raised on thursday');
END;
```

- What is Flashback Query?

  - Flashback query are handled by Database Administrator only. Flashback queries along allows content of the table to be retrieved with reference to specific point of time by using as of clause.
  - Flashback queries generally uses undo file that is flashback queries retrieve old data before committing the transaction oracle provide two method for flashback queries
    - Method1: using timestamp
    - Method2: using scn number

- What will be the result of the query below? Explain your answer and provide a version that behaves correctly.

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN NULL = NULL THEN 'YUP' ELSE 'NOPE' END AS RESULT FROM DUAL;

-- This query will actually yield “Nope”, seeming to imply
--that null is not equal to itself! The reason for this is
--that the proper way to compare a value to null in SQL is
--with the is operator, not with =. Accordingly, the
--correct version of the above query that yields the
--expected result (i.e., “Yup”) would be as follows:
```

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN NULL IS NULL THEN 'YUP' ELSE 'NOPE' END AS RESULT FROM DUAL;
--This is because null represents an unknown value. If you
--don’t know the value, you can’t know whether it equals
--another value, so = null is always assumed to be false.

```

- What will be the result of the query below?

```sql
SQL> SELECT * FROM runners;
```

| id  | name        |
| --- | ----------- |
| 1   | John Doe    |
| 2   | Jane Doe    |
| 3   | Alice Jones |
| 4   | Bobby Louis |
| 5   | Lisa Romero |

```sql
SQL> SELECT * FROM races;
```

| id  | event          | winner_id |
| --- | -------------- | --------- |
| 1   | 100 meter dash | 2         |
| 2   | 500 meter dash | 3         |
| 3   | cross-country  | 2         |
| 4   | triathalon     | NULL      |

```sql
SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races)
```

- - Surprisingly, given the sample data provided, the result of this query will be an empty set. The reason for this is as follows: If the set being evaluated by the SQL NOT IN condition contains any values that are null, then the outer query here will return an empty set, even if there are many runner ids that match winner_ids in the races table.
  - Knowing this, a query that avoids this issue would be as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races WHERE winner_id IS NOT null)
```

- Can we use having without aggregate function

```sql
SELECT department_id FROM employees GROUP BY department_id HAVING department_id IN (60,50)
```

- Write a query to fetch values in table test_a that are and not in test_b without using the NOT keyword.

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_a(id NUMERIC);
INSERT INTO test_a(id) VALUES (10);
INSERT INTO test_a(id) VALUES (20);
INSERT INTO test_a(id) VALUES (30);
INSERT INTO test_a(id) VALUES (40);
INSERT INTO test_a(id) VALUES (50);
INSERT INTO test_b(id) VALUES (10);
INSERT INTO test_b(id) VALUES (30);
INSERT INTO test_b(id) VALUES (50);
SELECT id FROM test_a MINUS SELECT id FROM test_b
```

- Given a table TBL with a field Nmbr that has rows with the following values; Write a query to add 2 where Nmbr is 0 and add 3 where Nmbr is 1.

```sql
1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1
UPDATE tbl SET nmbr = CASE WHEN nmbr = 0 THEN nmbr+2 ELSE nmbr+3 END;
```
