## Privileges

A privilege is a right to execute a particular type of SQL statement or to access another user's object. There are two categories of privileges:

### System Privileges

- A system privilege is the right to perform a particular action
- Only users who have been granted a specific system privilege with the ADMIN OPTION or users with the system privileges such as GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE or GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE can grant or revoke system privileges to other users
- Cannot grant system privileges and object privileges in single statement
- ADMIN OPTION is available while creating SYSTEM privileges only.

```sql
 GRANT CREATE ANY TABLE TO username;
----
GRANT CREATE SESSION , CREATE VIEW , CREATE SEQUENCE TO username;
----
GRANT CREATE PROCEDURE TO username1, username2;
----
GRANT CREATE TRIGGER TO username WITH ADMIN OPTION;
```

### Object Privileges

A object privilege is the right to perform a particular action on a specific schema object.

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON username.object_name TO other_username;
----
GRANT UPDATE , INSERT , INDEX , DELETE ON username.object_name TO other_username;
----
GRANT UPDATE(column_name) ON username.object_name TO other_username; -- for column only
----
GRANT UPDATE ON username.object_name TO other_username WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

## Syntax for tables

```sql
GRANT privilege-type ON [TABLE] { table-Name | view-Name } TO grantees
```

### privilege-types

```sql
ALL PRIVILEGES | -- privilege type to grant all of the privileges to the user or role for the specified table. You can also grant one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.
privilege-list
```

### privilege-list

```sql
table-privilege {, table-privilege }
```

### table-privilege

```sql
DELETE |
INSERT |
REFERENCES [column list] | -- privilege type to grant permission to create
a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified
with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is valid on only the foreign
key reference to the specified columns.
SELECT [column list] | -- If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is valid on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.
TRIGGER |
UPDATE [column list] -- If a column list is specified, the permission applies only to the specified columns. To update a row using a statement that includes a WHERE clause, you must have the SELECT privilege on the columns in the row that you want to update.
```

### column list

```sql
( column_name {, column_name}* )
```

### grantees

```sql
{ user_name | roleName | PUBLIC } [, { user_name| roleName | PUBLIC } ] *
Ex: GRANT SELECT ON TABLE schema_name.table_name to PUBLIC
```

## Syntax for routines

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON { FUNCTION | PROCEDURE } routine-designator TO grantees
```

### routine-designator

```sql
function-name | procedure-name
Ex: GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE procedure_name TO george;
Ex: GRANT EXECUTE ON package_name TO george; -- Package
```

## Syntax for sequence generators

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE [ schemaName. ] user_name TO grantees -- If a schemaName is not provided, the current schema is the default schema.
Ex: GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE order_id TO sales_role;
```

## Syntax for user-defined types

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON TYPE [ schemaName. ] user_name TO grantees
Ex: GRANT USAGE ON TYPE price TO finance_role;
```

## Syntax for roles

```sql
GRANT roleName [ {, roleName }* ] TO grantees
```

## Roles

Role is a group of privileges

```sql
CREATE ROLE role_name NOT IDENTIFIED; -- Not identified= no password is required to enable this role
----
CREATE ROLE role_name IDENTIFIED BY password; -- By default, the role granted will be disabled if it has password
----
SET ROLE role_name IDENTIFIED BY password;-- to enable role
----
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO role_name WITH ADMIN OPTION;
----
GRANT SELECT ON username.object_name TO role_name; --Grant privileges to role
----
GRANT role_name1 TO role_name2; -- copy all privileges from role_name1 to role_name2
----
GRANT role_name TO username; --Grant a role to user
```

## WITH ADMIN OPTION vs. WITH GRANT OPTION

| WITH GRANT OPTION                                                                         | WITH ADMIN OPTION                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only for object privileges, not system privileges.                                        | Only for system privileges, not object privileges.                                                                        |
| Revoking any grant will cascade and revoke any privileges assigned by the privileged user | Revoking any grant will only revoke the privileges of that user only (will not cascade), leaving all other users granted. |

## Database Link

It is an object that enables you to access object on another database. The other databases need not to be an Oracle Database system.

```sql
CREATE [PUBLIC] DATABASE LINK link_name
CONNECT TO remote_username IDENTIFIED BY remote_password USING 'hostname:port_number/SID' or 'TNS_Name'
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE LINK ACCDB CONNECT TO scott IDENTIFIED BY tiger USING 'DB1WORLD';
```

## EXISTS - NOT EXISTS vs. IN - NOT IN

- In most cases the Oracle cost-based optimizer will create an identical execution plan for IN vs EXISTS, so there is no difference in query performance.
- If you are using the IN operator, the SQL engine will scan all records fetched from the inner query. On the other hand, if we are using EXISTS, the SQL engine will stop the scanning process as soon as it found a match.
- The EXISTS clause is much faster than IN when the subquery results is very large. Conversely, the IN clause is faster than EXISTS when the subquery results is very small.
- IN clause won't return anything if there are NULL values, but the EXISTS will return.

```sql
SELECT * FROM departments WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT department_id FROM employees);-- AS there is one NULL value, query will not return any value
----
SELECT * FROM departments WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT NVL(department_id,0) FROM employees); --NVL to change the NULL
----
SELECT * FROM departments d WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees e WHERE e.department_id=d.department_id); --SELECT 1 because, EXISTS will only checks whether it returns any rows.
--We are giving the condition in co-related sub query
```

## CASE vs. DECODE

- DECODE performs an equality check only. CASE is capable of other logical comparisons such as < > etc.
- It is recommended to use CASE instead of DECODE
- DECODE is oracle proprietary function; CASE is ANSI standard
- CASE can be used in both SQL and PLSQL . But DECODE can be used only in SQL.
- CASE can be used in WHERE clause But you cant use DECODE in WHERE clause.
- CASE is Faster when compared to DECODE since DECODE is a function which takes time to load and run but the cost difference of DECODE and CASE is very very minimal.

## Hierarchical Queries

```sql
START WITH -> Define the root node(s) of the hierarchy
CONNECT BY -> Defines how the current row (child) relates to a prior row(parent)
PRIOR -> Previous(parent) level
LEVEL -> The position (indentation) in the hierarchy of the current row in relation to the root node
ORDER SIBLINGS BY -> Order of the rows which all shares the same parent row
CONNECT_BY_ROOT -> To get the root node associated with the current row
SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(column_name,'delimiter') -> Delimited break from the root node to the current row
CONNECT_BY_ISLEAF -> 1 for leaf nodes and 0 for non-leaf nodes
CONNECT BY NOCYCLE -> No to raise errors if loop exist. (Ex: KING is manager of BLAKE, BLAKE is manager of KING)
```

```sql
SELECT empno, ename, job, PRIOR ename --PRIOR ename = mgr name from previous level
FROM emp
START WITH mgr IS NULL
CONNECT BY mgr = PRIOR empno;
```

```sql
SELECT empno, ename, job, PRIOR ename FROM emp
START WITH empno = 7566
CONNECT BY mgr = PRIOR empno;
```

```sql
SELECT LPAD('', LEVEL *2, '') || family_member AS who, mother, father
FROM your_family
START WITH family_member in ('Aliyamma','Thomas') --level 1 of hierarchy
CONNECT BY NOCYCLE PRIOR family_member IN (mother,father) --PRIOR gives access to level above
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE your_family (family_member VARCHAR2(15),mother VARCHAR2(15),father VARCHAR2(15), birth_date DATE);
----
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Aliyamma',NULL,NULL,to_date('01/01/1980','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Thomas',NULL,NULL,to_date('01/01/1980','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Jose','Aliyamma','Thomas',to_date('01/01/1981','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Sheeja',NULL,NULL,to_date('01/01/1981','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Mercy','Aliyamma','Thomas',to_date('01/01/1983','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Winny',NULL,NULL,to_date('01/01/1983','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Annie','Aliyamma','Thomas',to_date('01/01/1982','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('James',NULL,NULL,to_date('01/01/1982','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Teni','Sheeja','Jose',to_date('01/01/1987','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Tom','Sheeja','Jose',to_date('01/01/1984','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Sini','Mercy','Winny',to_date('01/01/1988','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Nano','Mercy','Winny',to_date('01/01/1989','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Betty','Annie','James',to_date('01/01/1986','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Merly','Annie','James',to_date('01/01/1985','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Prince',NULL,NULL,to_date('01/01/1985','mm/dd/yyyy'));
INSERT INTO your_family VALUES('Nonu','Merly','Prince',to_date('01/01/1990','mm/dd/yyyy'));
ORDER SIBLINGS BY birth_date;
```

## Insert random data to table

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name
SELECT ROWNUM,
    FLOOR(DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE(90,9000)),
    TRUNC(SYSDATE) - FLOOR(DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE(90,9000))
FROM DUAL CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 1000000
```
